# coroutine-basics

Simple introduction to the main coroutine concepts. This repository contains the sample project shown in the talk: Kotlin Coroutine, Threading Made Easy in Android at the Droidcon Americas. You can find the video of the talk in my blog [euryperez.dev](https://euryperez.dev/live-sessions/live-session-kotlin-coroutine-threading-made-easy-in-android/)

# Branches

The repository has 3 branches:

1. *Skeleton*: Initial bootstrap of the project
2. Callback: Finished project using the callback pattern
3. Coroutines: Modified version of the callback branch using coroutines.

To follow the tutorial in the talk video, checkout to the callback branch and migrate the calls to coroutines.
